settings:
    ## If this is true, a standard index page is generated in the output directory.
    ## It uses the package information from the 'package.xml' to show details
    ## about the package, creates a table of contents for the various builders
    ## that were run, and may contain links to things like build farm jobs for
    ## this package or links to other versions of this package.
    ## If this is not specified explicitly, it defaults to 'true'.
    generate_package_index: true

    ## This setting is relevant mostly if the standard Python package layout cannot
    ## be assumed for 'sphinx-apidoc' invocation. The user can provide the path
    ## (relative to the 'package.xml' file) where the Python modules defined by this
    ## package are located.
    python_source: 'rclpy'

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user would like to generate C/C++ API documentation for a package that is not
    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.
    always_run_doxygen: false

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `sphinx-apidoc` regardless of build
    ## type. This is most useful if the user would like to generate Python API
    ## documentation for a package that is not of the `ament_python` build type.
    always_run_sphinx_apidoc: true

    # This setting, if True, will ensure breathe is part of the 'extensions',
    # and will set all of the breathe configurations, if not set, and override
    # settings as needed if they are set by this configuration.
    enable_breathe: false

    # This setting, if True, will ensure exhale is part of the 'extensions',
    # and will set all of the exhale configurations, if not set, and override
    # settings as needed if they are set by this configuration.
    enable_exhale: false

    # This setting, if provided, will override the build_type of this package
    # for documentation purposes only. If not provided, documentation will be
    # generated assuming the build_type in package.xml.
    override_build_type: 'ament_python'

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Required keys in the settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.

    # - doxygen: {
    #     name: 'rclpy Public C/C++ API',
    #     output_dir: 'generated/doxygen'
    # }
    - sphinx: {
        name: 'rclpy',
        ## This path is relative to output staging.
        # doxygen_xml_directory: 'generated/doxygen/xml',
        # todo: Provide user sphinx_sourcedir below after warnings have been addressed.
        sphinx_sourcedir: 'docs/source/',
