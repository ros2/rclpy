0.5.3 (2018-07-17)
------------------
* use test_msgs instead of std_msgs (`#204 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/204>`_)
* Fixes memory leaks for nested fields (`#203 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/203>`_)
  This separates memory allocation out from convert_from_py function.
  Now it uses separate create_message function to allocate message,
  making it explicit gives better control where and how memory is
  allocated and freed.

* Added API for counting the number of publishers and subscribers on a topic. (`#183 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/183>`_)

* Fixed ``rclpy_init()`` so that it actually passes command line arguments to ``rcl_init()`` (`#179 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/179>`_)
* Changed logging to get the node's logger name from rcl. (`#174 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/174>`_)
* Fixed a bug where ``rclpy_take_response()`` was ignoring the sequence number. (`#171 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/171>`_)
* Added support for Futures and coroutines in the executor. (`#166 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/166>`_)

  * Publish parameter events.
  Adds a parameter event publisher to rclpy nodes.
  * Increase base number of publishers for testing.
  Because every node has a parameter events publisher bump the number of
  expected publishers in a couple of cases.
  * Remove comment now that parameter services are implemented.
  * Delete NOT_SET parameters if present regardless of prior type.
  * Use ParameterMsg rather than RCLParameter for msg type name.
